NutriScan App Icon Design Specification
=====================================

Design Concept:
- A modern, clean representation of health and nutrition
- Incorporates both leaf (nature/health) and scanning (technology) elements
- Uses the brand colors: #4CAF50 (primary green) and #2E7D32 (dark green)

Elements:
1. Base Shape: Circle (standard for app icons)
2. Main Symbol: Abstract leaf shape with scanning lines
3. Color Scheme:
   - Primary: #4CAF50 (vibrant green)
   - Secondary: #2E7D32 (deep green)
   - Accent: #E8F5E9 (light green for scan lines)
   - Background: White

Detailed Design:
- Background: Solid white circle
- Leaf Shape: Abstract leaf in gradient from #4CAF50 to #2E7D32
- Scan Lines: 4 horizontal lines in #E8F5E9, representing scanning action
- Center Element: Small dark green circle representing the core/nucleus
- Glow Effect: Subtle radial gradient for depth

Size Requirements:
- Create multiple sizes for different devices:
  - 1024x1024 (base)
  - 512x512
  - 256x256
  - 192x192
  - 180x180
  - 144x144
  - 120x120
  - 96x96
  - 72x72
  - 48x48
  - 36x36

Implementation Steps:
1. Open the new_app_icon.svg file in a vector editor
2. Export as PNG at 1024x1024 resolution
3. Use an icon generator tool to create all required sizes
4. Replace the current app_icon.png with the new design
5. Run 'flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons' to generate all icons
